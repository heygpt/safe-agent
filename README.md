# Safe Agent: Your Secure Copilot in Web3

The **Safe Agent**, a powerful tool designed to empower everyone to securely manage their on-chain transactions, powered by **Safe** for Multisig wallet management and Enso for trading.

The core concept of Safe Agent is simple yet powerful: whenever a user transfers or trades tokens on-chain, Safe Agent acts as a vigilant copilot, verifying whether the recipient or the tokens involved are associated with scams, honeypots, malicious activities, money laundering, financial crimes, or even sanctions.

Here’s how it works:

### Key Features
#### 1. Real-Time Risk Detection:
Continuously monitors transactions for potential risks, including scams, fraud, and malicious activities.

#### 2. Token Safety Assessment:
Evaluates tokens for risks such as rug pulls, honeypots, and impersonators.

#### 3.  Address Validation:
Ensures interactions only with legitimate addresses, minimizing exposure to scams.

### Workflow
Whenever a user transfers or trades tokens onchain, Safe Agent acts as a copilot, automatically verifying the security of:

✅ The recipient – Checking for potential scams, malicious actors, and financial crime risks.

✅ The tokens being purchased – Detecting honeypots, high-risk assets, and sanctioned entities.

#### 1. Transaction Initiation:
A user initiates a transfer or trade on-chain.

#### 2. Risk Verification:
Safe Agent scans the recipient address and tokens for potential risks.

#### 3. Real-Time Alerts:
If risks are detected, the user is immediately alerted with detailed insights.

#### 4. Secure Execution:
The transaction proceeds only after the user confirms, ensuring full control and security.
